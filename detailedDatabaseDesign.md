# 2.0 Detailed Database Design

## 2.1 Project description, database engine used, potential users, Miscellaneous

### 2.1.1 Project Description
We are working on a music database called Music Palace which allows users to
easily access and store their music. The users will not be able to share
their music with other users; the database will be for personal storage only.
We plan on only storing either the url of a song or the audio file and not
their respective music videos and the database of choice will be mySQL.
### 2.1.2 Database Engine Used
We are using SQL to complete our database project and we are using a MusicID for our primary key. We want to have it so that our engine has a table that allows the user to look up songs and can add them easily or a user can add their own music with the add button which the user must fill out certain criteria such as the name of the song, artist, and album its from. 
### 2.1.3 Potential users
The primary user base will be people who listen to music so almost everyone. It will
be for people that want to store their music and who want to be able to access it
easily and quickly.
### 2.1.4 Miscellaneous
