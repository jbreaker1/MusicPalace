# Project Status Reports

### 10/1/17 ~ This was our first meeting. We started planning our idea of a music database. We decided that we wanted to make a database where users could be added. These users could then add songs of their choice. These songs will be organized by genre, artist, and album.

### 10/15/17 ~ In our second meeting. We started working on our Preliminary Database Design Document. We crafted a more detailed description of what our database will entail. We decided that our target audience will be people who listen to music (which is almost anyone). We felt that this was a good idea since we would have a large pool of people who would be potentially interested in using our database. During this meeting, Jay also picked the name Music Palace for our database.

### 10/16/17 ~ During this meeting we finished our Preliminary Database Design Document. We built the different tables that our database will include: The Song Table, The User Table, and the Music Palace Table.

### 11/6/17 ~ In this meeting, we started working on the Detailed Database Design Document. We initially decided to use mySQL for our database. After attempting to start our project, we then discovered that mySQL would not be ideal to store .mp3 files. We then decided to use mongo instead. Mongo makes it easy to store audio files and urls. Mongo also allows for easy lookup of songs after they are added to the database.

### 11/7/17 ~ During this meeting, we also completed the ERD for our database project.

### 11/11/17 ~ On this day, Jay and I did not meet in person but installed mongo separately on our own laptops. We also tried simple commands to add collections to our database.

### 11/12/17 ~ During this meeting we worked from home and Elizabeth learned how to use mongofiles to successfully add .mp3 files to our database. Jay learned how to add a new user for a database. We then shared this information with each other via Slack.

### 11/19/17 ~ During this meeting, we added a few .mp3 files to our database, and added the data associated with each song, i.e. Artist, Genre, Album, and Year Produced.

### 11/25/17 ~ We created .js files to do our mongo commands to make the user experience and testing of our database easier.

### 11/27/17 ~ During our last meeting, we practiced our presentation by running the commands that we plan on demonstrating to the class. We also finished adding .js files to navigate our database.
