Good job on this document.

For section 1.3, you should have more detailed information about what the
user will be wanting to see.  For example, "How many songs were produced in
2011?" or "What album contains the song 'My Way' produced in 1935?"

The ERD looks great, but you need to underline the primary keys.

Nice work...

Total: 9.5% out of 10% which is an A.
