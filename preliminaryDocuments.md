Project Preliminary Database Design :
1.
  1.1 ~ We are working on something called Music Palace which allows users to
        easily access and store their music. The primary user base will be people
        who listen to music so almost everyone. The users will not be able to share
        their music with other users; the database will be for personal storage only.
        We plan on only storing either
        the url of a song or the actual song in a file and not their respective
        music videos and the database of choice will be mySQL.
  1.2 ~ The data we will be storing will be audio files as well as urls because
        that way if someone just wants to save the link to a song instead of
        storing the entire song it saves space and makes it convenient for the
        user.
  1.3 ~ The database will provide a user with their audio files, url to songs,
        their account information, information regarding a certain song such as artist
        and genre, and all the songs in a certain album.
